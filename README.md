### Pentagon-Business-Com-V2
This project will be used as the new company website. The aim is to increase the number of possible clients that visit the website and actually acquire products. Therefore, the development focused on two main areas: 
- revamping the look of the website (a better presentation of the company & its products is sure to inquire further) 
- adding an E-Shop section, in order to open a new sales channel

The Notus React UI kit was used in the development of the frontend side of the project.
